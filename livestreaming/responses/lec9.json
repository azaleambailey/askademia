        "Recent Audio": "also include condition using juxtaposition as opposed to superposition. Superposition is that you plot multiple things on the same plot. We could also put different conditions side by side. It's called a small multiples that we're plotting so that for different conditions you're plotting different things side by side so that. We can compare them more accurately. The last thing that I want to briefly talk about is that context is really important. Again, going back to two reasons that we do visualization. We do visualization for yourself in the ETA and we do visualization for reporting. If you do it for yourself, it can be lightweight. It can be just a simple, not so nice math bloodlet plot that you're creating. If you're trying to plot something for reporting, then you need to consider using all the channels more efficiently. Have the have every plot that you have, have ** label, Y label, title. Nice. Also legend on all of the plots and so on and so forth. This is the last thing that we'll have on the visualization. Kind of as a take away point is that now you know how to create different plots, how to efficiently plot different variables, how to plot association between different variables, and then how to use all the information channels that you have available on the canvas of. But more efficiently and consider color scale and so on and so forth. Thank you for coming. We will see you on Thursday. Good morning, everyone. There we go.",

We might get a skewed view of how the population behaves (consider the extreme case where we happen to sample the exact same value $n$ times!). \n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/CLTdiff.png\" alt='clt' width='400'>\n</p>\nFor example, notice the difference in variation between these two distributions that are different in sample size. The distribution with a bigger sample size ($n=8\nat haphazard sampling is not necessarily random sampling; there are many potential sources of bias.\nIn a **probability sample**, we provide the **chance** that any specified **set** of individuals will be in the sample (individuals in the population can have different chances of being selected; they don't all have to be uniform), and we sample at random based off this known chance. For this reason, probability samples are also called **random samples**. The randomness provides a few benefits: \n* Because we \n*sample** is (usually) a subset of the population that is often used to make inferences about the population. If our sample is a good representation of our population, then we can use it to glean useful information at a lower cost. That being said, how the sample is drawn will affect the reliability of such inferences. Two common sources of error in sampling are **chance error**, where random samples can vary from what is expected in any direction, and  **bias**, which is a systematic error in one direction",

Keeping things simple, generally the way you're going to control bias is thinking about your sampling frame, and you're going to pick a good sampling process that doesn't add bias inside of that sampling frame. That's what we strive for. What about chance air? What does that look like in this picture? How can I make chance air smaller? Should I change the size of this circle? It's gonna affect my bias with this circle. Yeah, I want to make chance there smaller should make this circle bigger. We make the size of my entire sampling frame. There's no chance there. Every single time I'm going to get exactly the same result. Every single sample is the same. Still a lot of bias possibly. But no chance here. So this would be a really, I'll make it not quite, but you know, pretty big. That was my sample. My chance there got a lot smaller. How many ways I can take that many individuals? OK, some good pictures. How are you engaging with today's lecture slide? Oh, survey if you will. Shocking. I like the the 6071% of this class engages in person. And 26% asynchronously. Wait, how are you watching the recording? Sorry, it's not there yet. You lie. What is asynchronous? Something else? You're attending election? We should fix this.

Keeping things simple, generally the way you're going to control bias is thinking about your sampling frame, and you're going to pick a good sampling process that doesn't add bias inside of that sampling frame. That's what we strive for. What about chance air? What does that look like in this picture? How can I make chance air smaller? Should I change the size of this circle? It's gonna affect my bias with this circle. Yeah, I want to make chance there smaller should make this circle bigger. We make the size of my entire sampling frame. There's no chance there. Every single time I'm going to get exactly the same result. Every single sample is the same. Still a lot of bias possibly. But no chance here. So this would be a really, I'll make it not quite, but you know, pretty big. That was my sample. My chance there got a lot smaller. How many ways I can take that many individuals? OK, some good pictures. How are you engaging with today's lecture slide? Oh, survey if you will. Shocking. I like the the 6071% of this class engages in person. And 26% asynchronously. Wait, how are you watching the recording? Sorry, it's not there yet. You lie. What is asynchronous? Something else? You're attending election? We should fix this. All right, I'm going to assume watch recording means you're watching it live. Great. Yeah. So someone doesn't know how to do survey design and that is me, all right.",

So where's my sample people respond to slide on. We had a pretty good response, right? I think like 400 plus people. Nice. So what can I conclude? Most people come to lecture, and for those online, check out this entirely full lecture hall. Right. 70% of you are coming to lecture watching it live. It's amazing. There's a bias, right? Ask the question to the population. Also for those online, there's spaces in the lecture halls. You should come in a few spaces. Yeah. So there's a bias, pretty big bias, right? My sampling frame is biased towards maybe the conclusion I wanted. Understanding this allows me to say that conclusion I just drew 70% of you were watching. Live is probably not true, right? I have to understand my sampling frame. I have to understand my sample. Plumber. All right, so let's talk about a famous case study and sampling bias.

It occurs because the sample drawn from the population can vary in any direction due to random noise or fluctuations. For example, if you randomly select a group of people to survey, the specific individuals chosen might not perfectly represent the entire population, leading to differences between the sample results and the true population characteristics. This type of error is not systematic and can be reduced by increasing the sample size or improving the sampling method.",

That would be a simple random sample. But here there's only 10 possible groups that I could build, right? Yeah, 10 possible groups I can build of 110 students. Questions. All right, let's do this. Let's take a 2 minute break and we'll come back and do some coding exercises. Doing a break starting now.",

        "Timestamp": 3664,
        "TA Response": "Hello, an SRS states that each group has to have the same probability of being selected. Since we sample at random one of the first 10 students at random and then choose every 10th student after, the pair (8, 18) has a 1/10 probability of being selected (if the student we got in the first 10 students was the 8th). However, (8,9) is not possible (so it has a 0% probability) because we can't get the 8th student and then the 9th student (has be either 18, 28, etc).",
